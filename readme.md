This Repo will hold code to render data from a copilot export of transactions
into a view broken down by month and save that render as a pdf file.
I plan to run this locally.

This is a project that I am trying to get a tangible asset from, so I will lean
towards using things that are familiar, ie python django, rather than something
new and fun that would take longer to develop.

## TODO:

1. Choose web library (django, flask, fastapi or other)
   * My first though is django, although it is a bit much for the end goal, it is familiar.
   * After trying django for I realized that the faster options are worth a try and now I am using flask and it seems to do what I need
2.  Open and render the data
3. Save to pdf
